## Reproducible vs. Replicable

### **no distinction** (A)
  
--
  
### **distinction** :
- for some (B1):
  - *reproducible*: authors provide data + computer code to re-create the results.
  - *replicable*: new study same scientific findings as another study, collecting new
  data and new analyses.
- for others (B2): opposite definitions

# Terminology is being clarified

> We define **reproducibility** to mean **computational reproducibility**—­
obtaining consistent computational results using the same **input data**, computational steps, methods, **code**, and conditions of analysis; 

--

> and **replicability** to mean obtaining **consistent results across studies aimed at answering the
same scientific question**, each of which has obtained its own data. 

--

> In short, reproducibility involves the original data and code; replicability involves
new data collection and similar methods used by previous studies.

### **Can do**: make resaerch findings more robusts

<br>

### **Require**: making data and code open

- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) 
- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)
- etc.



---
# How do reproduce studies

### **Collateral benefits**

- re-usage of code can lead to an increase of efficiency;
- improved coding skills;

--

### **Cons**

- takes **a lot** of time.

> It is also important to recognize that **there are costs and barriers to shifting to a practice
of reproducible research**, particularly when the culture does not recognize the value of
developing this new paradigm or the effort that can be required to develop or learn to use
suitable tools. This is of particular concern to young people who need to earn tenure
or secure a permanent position.

### Towards full reproducibility, technologies are increasingly complex

- entire pipeline in code
- record all version of software used in the workflow
- code should not be impacted by OS or hardware


---
# Is R suitable for Reproducible?

### YES YES and YES! 

### Ropensci


---
# You are almost there 

- input data in one place and never modify them afterwards

- R scripts in one place 

well... that's a very good beginning 


---
# Create a R folder 

Create a meaningful set up 

- R/
- data/
- doc/Rmd <- articulated pipeline 

---
# Create a R folder 

Ensure that all code work from root; ensure form starts 

attached an sessionInfo()


---
# Create a R folder 

Use version comtrol 
Make your in a remote/virtual machine...

towards the gold standard, technologies are increasingly more complex 


---
# IMHO 

- make data avaialble 
- attached local repo in appendix, a zip file
- sessionInfo()

This would be just wonderful.... this would be a huge stepo. 

At the end I'll talk about breofly about a set of R packages and other techno/software that allow omne to ge further,.

# Quote



> The fact that an analysis is reproducible does
not guarantee the quality, correctness, or validity of the published results. (Peng, 2011)


> Unfortunately, the mere reproducibility of
Reproducibility—the ability to recompute
results—and replicability—the chances other
experimenters will achieve a consistent
result—are two foundational characteristics
of successful scientific research. (Leek and Peng 2015)

[Roger D. Peng](https://github.com/rdpeng)

# Different R version different results


```R
# R 3.6
df <- data.frame(fact = rep(c("F1", "F2"), each = 5), val = runif(10))
plot(val ~ fact, data = df)   # works 
# R 4.0
df <- data.frame(fact = rep(c("F1", "F2"), each = 5), val = runif(10))
plot(val ~ fact, data = df)   # does not work
```
