### **no distinction** (A)

--

### **distinction** :
- for some (B1):
  - *reproducible*: authors provide data + computer code to re-create the results.
  - *replicable*: new study same scientific findings as another study, collecting new
  data and new analyses.
--

- for others (B2): opposite definitions

> We define **reproducibility** to mean **computational reproducibility**—­
obtaining consistent computational results using the same **input data**, computational steps, methods, **code**, and conditions of analysis;

> and **replicability** to mean obtaining **consistent results across studies aimed at answering the
same scientific question**, each of which has obtained its own data.

> In short, reproducibility involves the original data and code; replicability involves
new data collection and similar methods used by previous studies.

### .font140[Reproducibility will not solve all issues]

> Unfortunately, the mere reproducibility of computational results is

# How to reproduce studies


### .font140[**Obstacle**: it takes **a lot** of time]

> It is also important to recognize that there are costs and barriers to shifting to a practice
of reproducible research, particularly when the culture does not recognize the value of
developing this new paradigm or the effort that can be required to develop or learn to use
suitable tools. This is of particular concern to young people who need to earn tenure
or secure a permanent position.

I've spent a lot of time on making my studies reproducible but not even sure sb re-run my code, not even sure it'll be useful. What is sure is that I didn't spend that time on other paper and I am "more proud of what I have done". But so far, without a system shift, it could be regarded as a virtue. I am very happy to see DFO is taking this very seriously and understood the collateral benefits. Yes it pays off. There is less technical obstacle, there are better practice. You can do more.

### Towards full reproducibility, technologies are getting more complex

- entire pipeline in a versioned repository

--

- record all version(s) of software(s) used in the workflow

--

- run code without being impacted by OS or hardware

Before making the topics more complex that needed.
We are aiming at given you a sense of this!!

Avoid re-doing every by hand! Instead, set up your repository.



---
# You might not be that far!

### R is suitable for Reproducibility

- open source (no license-related issues)

--

- strong community actively engaged in making science more reproducible

--

- A large diversity of package for reproducibility purposes
  - packages to improve the workflow

--

- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)


???

community ==> made of R user
and so are Python and Julia

  - input/raw data
  - processed data
  - data may be archived on line (e.g. Dryad) and may be accessed via a script (see [rdryad](https://docs.ropensci.org/rdryad/))

## Follow 3 simple rules!


### 1. The folder must be self contained

  - think of the root of the folder as the root of the system
  - nothing beyond locally
  - ~~C:\user/data\dat0001.txt~~
  - but this system is not isolated (e.g. remote)
  - does not mean everything will be shared

---
# You might not be that far!


## Follow 3 simple rules!

### 2. document massively

  - your datasets (could be a link to relevant documentation)
  - your functions and scripts
  - and the trick you've used that won't be clear to others (that future yourself)
