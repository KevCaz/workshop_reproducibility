## Reproducible vs. Replicable

### **no distinction** (A)
  
--
  
### **distinction** :
- for some (B1):
  - *reproducible*: authors provide data + computer code to re-create the results.
  - *replicable*: new study same scientific findings as another study, collecting new
  data and new analyses.
- for others (B2): opposite definitions

# Terminology is being clarified

> We define **reproducibility** to mean **computational reproducibility**—­
obtaining consistent computational results using the same **input data**, computational steps, methods, **code**, and conditions of analysis; 

--

> and **replicability** to mean obtaining **consistent results across studies aimed at answering the
same scientific question**, each of which has obtained its own data. 

--

> In short, reproducibility involves the original data and code; replicability involves
new data collection and similar methods used by previous studies.

# Terminology is being clarified

It's a topic about research but quickly due to its nature we are talking about technologies.

only retrieve data!!not carry out experiment 
getting more complex in terms of computataional steps.

## Why (`r icon::fontawesome("clock")` ~ 15min)


???

Mostly tips and structure of the R

--- 
# You are almost there 

- input data in one place and never modify them afterwards

- R scripts in one place 

well... that's a very good beginning 


---
# Create a R folder 

Create a meaningful set up 

- R/
- data/
- doc/Rmd <- articulated pipeline 

---
# Create a R folder 

Ensure that all code work from root; ensure form starts 

attached an sessionInfo()


---
# Create a R folder 

Use version comtrol 
Make your in a remote/virtual machine...

towards the gold standard, technologies are increasingly more complex 


---
# IMHO 

- make data avaialble 
- attached local repo in appendix, a zip file
- sessionInfo()

This would be just wonderful.... this would be a huge stepo. 

At the end I'll talk about breofly about a set of R packages and other techno/software that allow omne to ge further,.

# Quote


> we propose to ally the word reproducibility—currently the most widely used
> single term in this domain—with descriptors for the underlying construct This
> yields three terms: methods reproducibility, results reproducibility, and
> inferential reproducibility. (Goodman, 2016)
 
> The fact that an analysis is reproducible does
not guarantee the quality, correctness, or valid-
ity of the published results. (Peng, 2011)


> Unfortunately, the mere reproducibility of
Reproducibility—the ability to recompute
results—and replicability—the chances other
experimenters will achieve a consistent
result—are two foundational characteristics
of successful scientific research. (Leek and Peng 2015)
