### **no distinction** (A)

--

### **distinction** :
- for some (B1):
  - *reproducible*: authors provide data + computer code to re-create the results.
  - *replicable*: new study same scientific findings as another study, collecting new
  data and new analyses.
--

- for others (B2): opposite definitions

# Terminology is being clarified

> We define **reproducibility** to mean **computational reproducibility**—­
obtaining consistent computational results using the same **input data**, computational steps, methods, **code**, and conditions of analysis;

--

> and **replicability** to mean obtaining **consistent results across studies aimed at answering the
same scientific question**, each of which has obtained its own data.

--

> In short, reproducibility involves the original data and code; replicability involves
new data collection and similar methods used by previous studies.

2. robustness of a finding science

# Terminology is being clarified

> A third concept, **generalizability**, refers to the **extent that results of a study apply** in other contexts or populations that differ from the original one.

what the scope of the finding. There is a study on stressor that affect 
the mortality of a given bird species. Then I think studying this on a second 
bird species and I don't find any significance. Then studies may very well be replicable 
but it is not generalizabe to the second bird species.

# Reproducibility is tied to computer science

### **1. Scientific studies should be replicable (Material & Methods)**

It's a topic about research but quickly due to its nature we are talking about technologies.

# How to reproduce studies

### .font140[Reproducibility will not solve all issues]

> Unfortunately, the mere reproducibility of computational results is
> insufficient to address the replication crisis because even a reproducible
> analysis can suffer from many problems—confounding from omitted variables,
> poor study design, missing data—that threaten the validity and useful

# How to reproduce studies


### .font140[**Obstacle**: it takes **a lot** of time]

> It is also important to recognize that there are costs and barriers to shifting to a practice
of reproducible research, particularly when the culture does not recognize the value of
developing this new paradigm or the effort that can be required to develop or learn to use
suitable tools. This is of particular concern to young people who need to earn tenure
or secure a permanent position.

I've spent a lot of time on making my studies reproducible but not even sure sb re-run my code, not even sure it'll be useful. What is sure is that I didn't spend that time on other papers and I am "more proud of what I have done". But so far, without a system shift, it could be regarded as a virtue. I am very happy to see DFO is taking this very seriously and understood the collateral benefits. Yes it pays off. There is less technical obstacle, there are better practice. You can do more.

## There are clear benefits of using a reproducible workflow!

click and change all values... will certainly lead to errors...
Avoid re-doing every by hand! Instead, set up your repository.

### Towards full reproducibility, technologies are getting more complex

- entire pipeline in a versioned repository

--

- record all version(s) of software(s) used in the workflow

--

- run code without being impacted by OS or hardware



???

You quickly get benefits! 

Before making the topics more complex that needed.
We are aiming at given you a sense of this!!



---
# You might not be that far!

### `r rfa("r-project")` is suitable for Reproducibility

- open source (no license-related issues)

--

- strong community actively engaged in making science more reproducible

--

- A large diversity of package for reproducibility purposes
  - packages to improve the workflow

--

- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)


???

community ==> made of R user
and so are Python and Julia

# You might not be that far!


- `r emj("file_folder")` `R` : R code (`.R` files)

  - functions, scripts ...
  - data retrieval, statistical analysis, figure

<br>

--

- `r emj("file_folder")` `data` :

  - input/raw data
  - processed data
  - data may be archived on line (e.g. Dryad) and may be accessed via a script (see [rdryad](https://docs.ropensci.org/rdryad/))

---
# You might not be that far!


- `r emj("file_folder")` `output` (`fig` `tab`):

  - figures
  - tables

<br>

--

- `r emj("file_folder")` `ms` (`doc`)

  - main manuscript
  - Supplementary Information (SI)

# You might not be that far!


## Follow 3 simple rules!


### 1. The folder must be self contained

  - think of the root of the folder as the root of the system
  - ~~C:\user/data\dat0001.txt~~
  - but this system is not isolated (e.g. remote)
  - does not mean everything will be shared / added in the research compendium

---
# You might not be that far!


## Follow 3 simple rules!

### 2. document massively

  - your datasets (could be a link to relevant documentation)
  - your functions and scripts
  - and the tricks you've used that won't be clear to others (that includes future yourself!)

---
# You might not be that far!


## Follow 3 simple rules!


### 3. Keep track of all versions you've used

  - R version (and other software)
  - Package versions

# You might not be that far! `r emj("computer")`


## A minimal workflow with this folder

--

### 1. Add data / edit code

--

### 2. source R function / render your manuscript / `pipeline()`

--

### 3. repeat until your entire analysis is completed!
